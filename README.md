# Module 6 React Framework

I made an application using the React Framework Next.js, connected it to the CMS Strapi and
deployed it in the cloud platform Vercel.

## My (not so) Private library 
I decided to make a private library where a user could search for books via the Google books API and add them to his private collection. 

There are three collection types to store the books in: 
- want to read 
- currently reading
- finished reading

In the future I would like to add:
- a login system
- a way to see all the books in the library on one page
- search the library itself
- sort by authors
- personal reviews and favorites tags
